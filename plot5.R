# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

# Note: this question is quite vague: 
# 1) Only those categories that relate to the phrase "motor vehicle"?
# 2) Everything to do with "vehicle" sources (including manufacture emissions etc)
# 3) Just to do with vehicles fuel combustion emissions?
#
# Without specifics, I've gone with #2

# calculate total  US PM2.5 for each year (convert ton to kiloton) for
# vehicle related sources for Baltimore only
